Analyzed a real-world health dataset to explore how various factors such as income, gender, and insurance type influence hospital visits and days of reduced activity due to illness. The goal was to derive meaningful healthcare insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.
From the analysis I got the following insight:
A noticeable correlation between income levels and hospital admissions

Visualization of gender-wise differences in reduced activity days

Breakdown of insurance coverage across private and government plans

Identified trends in illness types and demographics that affect hospital visits
